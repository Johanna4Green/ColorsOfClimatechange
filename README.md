Visualizing Sentiments: Exploring the Color Palette of Climate Change Discourse on TikTok and Instagram


## Abstract
As Climate Change is of extreme concern, understanding the nuances of the conversations on Social Media can be crucial for gauging public awareness, sentiments, and potential avenues for impactful interventions. In this research project the goal is to gather a general understanding of climate discussion on visual social media content through a variety of methods and, more specifically, to find out if there is a significant association between a climate-related Instagram or TikTok postâ€™s color and its sentiment. For the analysis of posts about climate change on Social Media platforms a corpus of over 6900 posts across six climate-related key hashtags (three English and three German) was created. By combining and validating manual annotation of the images via LabelStudio and Large Language Models as well as image processing algorithms, sentiment, visual elements and thematic clusters in both textual and visual content were captured. We found significant platform differences in the data, as well as effects of both textual and visual sentiment on image color composition. The most striking result shows that, while the colors on TikTok appeared to be more black and reddish, which might be explained by constraints in aspect ratio (always vertical) and people-focused amateur content, on Instagram the colors are more white, blueish and bright, hinting at a greater focus on the appearance of professionalism.
